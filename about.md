# Summary
I am a developer, consultant and student based in Texas. I spend a lot of my time researching and consulting on blockchain systems, cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum projects. When I'm not doing crypto, I enjoy reading, gaming, camping, and traveling to new places with tasty food. I'm currently splitting my time between consulting and running the [Blockchain Club](http://utdallas.orgsync.com/org/blockchainandcryptographicsystemsorganizationutd161270) at UT Dallas.
